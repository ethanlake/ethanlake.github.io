    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12856">Fermi liquid RG revisited ï¼ˆunpublished)</a> </br> </br> tl;dr: The standard Fermi liquid RG scheme as formulated e.g. by Shankar has one unsavory aspect: certain couplings are classified as marginal, even though they do not affect the IR physics. This problem can be fixed by using an alternate, more natural RG scheme  </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.12579">Pairing symmetry of twisted bilayer graphene: a phenomenological synthesis 
    </a></br> </br> tl;dr: Experiments have advanced to the point where the pairing symmetry of the superconductor in twisted bilayer graphene can likely be nearly uniquely determined on experimental grounds alone, without relying on any particular assumptions from theory. This analysis suggests that the spin part of the pairing is a mixture of singlet and triplet, and that the orbital part is either p- or d-wave, with future Andreev tunneling measurements able to distinguish between the two. </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04132">The dipolar Bose-Hubbard model 
    </a></br> </br> tl;dr: The dynamics of systems with dipole moment conservation has been the subject of intense recent study. Comparatively little attention however has focused on the consequences of dipole conservation for equilibrium physics. In this work we study a simple dipole-conserving modification of the Bose-Hubbard model, and show that dipole conservation drastically modifies the phase diagram. In particular, the superfluid of the Bose-Hubbard model is replaced by an `Bose-Einstein insulator': a phase which has a BEC and U(1) symmetry breaking, but which is not a superfluid.  </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00742">Topological Mott insulators and discontinuous U(1) theta terms
    </a></br> </br> tl;dr: We study a 2+1d lattice field theory which captures a series of transitions between superfluids and topological Mott insulators.  </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08041">Spontaneous breaking of multipole symmetries
    </a></br> </br> tl;dr: We construct generalized Mermin-Wagner arguments that tell one when thermal and quantum fluctuations prevent multipole symmetries from spontaneously breaking. We also give generalized Imry-Ma arguments for the robustness of such multipolar symmetry breaking to disorder.  </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02986">RG and stability in the exciton Bose liquid</a> </br> </br> tl;dr: The exciton Bose liquid (EBL) is a model of bosons hopping on a square lattice, which is interesting because it exhibits UV / IR mixing: low-energy modes exist on scales all the way down to the lattice spacing. This work discusses how to think about questions relating to RG and universality in this model, and how to determine whether or not the theory can be realized without fine-tuning (answer: no for the simplest version of the theory, but probably yes for slightly more complicated versions).   </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09073">Subdimensional criticality: condensation of lineons and planons in the X-cube model</a> </br> </br> tl;dr: Continous phase transitions out of fracton orders exist, with the simplest examples being various condensation transitions in the X-Cube model. These condensation transitions can have either quasi-1d or quasi-2d critical exponents, and the condensed phases can be rigorously identified as various types of deconfined gauge theories. </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13920">  Re-entrant Superconductivity Through a Quantum Lifshitz Transition in Twisted Trilayer Graphene</a></br> </br> tl;dr: Twisted trilayer graphene superconducts in a non-singlet way, and posseses a field-induced transition into a distinct high-field superconducting state. These observations can be explained using a combination of phenomenological and theoretical reasoning, suggesting that the high-field phase possesses finite momentum pairing and is reached via a quantum Lifshitz point. </li>

    <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02197">Bose-Luttinger liquids</a> </br> </br> tl;dr: Interesting bosonic versions of Fermi liquids can exist in systems with special dispersion relations. Like Fermi liquids these systems have a ``large'' number of low-energy degrees of freedom, are metallic, have an large number of emergent conservation laws, etc. Unlike Fermi liquids they are not stabilized by degeneracy pressure, do not have quasiparticles, and have correlation functions controlled by continuously-varying exponents </li>

Examples exist where the transition is Landau-allowed, but has a critical point described by an emergent non-Abelian gauge theory  </li>
